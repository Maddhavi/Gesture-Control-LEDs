# Gesture-Control-LEDs
# Finger Detection LED Controller  

 🚀 Project Overview  
This project integrates Arduino and OpenCV to create a gesture-controlled LED lighting system. The system detects the number of fingers raised in a camera frame and lights up the corresponding number of LEDs. It's an exciting application combining computer vision and hardware!  



🔧 Features  
- Real-time finger detection using OpenCV.  
- LED control via Arduino based on the detected number of fingers.  
- Seamless interaction between software and hardware.  
- A fun and interactive way to explore gesture recognition.  



 🖥️ Technologies Used  
- Arduino: For controlling the LEDs.  
- OpenCV: For real-time hand and finger detection.  
- Python: To process video frames and communicate with Arduino.
